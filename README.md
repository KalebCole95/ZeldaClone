# ZeldaClone

A zelda clone game written using JavaFX

This project was started my sophmore year of college, after a month or two of testing this is the current result. I planned on continueing this project sometime, but since i am currently working in C++, Verilog, and MatLab for classes I have discontinued this project for now. I will probebly reevaluate the project and see if C++ or Java is the language I want to use in the future.
